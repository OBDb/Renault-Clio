generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1990
    end_year: 1998
    description: "The first generation Renault Clio, introduced as the successor to the Renault 5, was designed by Patrick Le Quément and marked a significant step forward in Renault's supermini offerings. Initially available as a three or five-door hatchback, the Clio featured a rounded, aerodynamic design that helped earn it the European Car of the Year award in 1991. Engine options included small gasoline units ranging from 1.1 to 1.8 liters and diesel variants, with power outputs between 55 and 137 horsepower in the sporty Clio Williams edition that was created to homologate variants for rally competition. The interior was relatively spacious for its class and featured more modern design elements than its predecessor. Throughout its production, this generation received several updates, including additional engine options, improved safety features, and minor styling revisions. The performance-oriented models, particularly the Clio Williams with its 2.0-liter 16-valve engine, helped establish Renault's reputation for producing engaging small performance cars. The first-generation Clio was instrumental in cementing Renault's position in the European supermini market with over 4 million units sold worldwide."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The second generation Renault Clio built upon the success of its predecessor with a more mature design and improved quality. Again penned by Patrick Le Quément, the new Clio grew in size and took on a more substantial, rounded appearance with distinctive oval headlights. Available in three or five-door body styles, this generation also saw the introduction of the Clio Sport Tourer estate variant in some markets. Engine options expanded to include more efficient and powerful units, ranging from 1.0-liter to 2.0-liter gasoline engines and improved diesel options including the 1.5 dCi. The performance-oriented Clio RS (Renault Sport) featured a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter engine producing up to 182 horsepower in later versions. The interior quality improved significantly with better materials and modern features like satellite navigation becoming available on higher trim levels. Safety was enhanced with the inclusion of more airbags and improved structural design, earning the car a 4-star Euro NCAP safety rating—impressive for its time. A facelift in 2001 introduced the 'new face of Renault' with a revised front-end design featuring a prominent emblem and reshaped headlights. The second-generation Clio continued Renault's strong presence in the supermini segment, particularly in Europe, with approximately 4.5 million units sold globally."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The fourth generation Renault Clio marked a significant design departure under the direction of Laurens van den Acker, featuring more emotional styling with pronounced curves, hidden rear door handles creating a coupe-like profile, and distinctive LED daytime running lights. Built on the new CMF-B platform, this Clio was offered exclusively as a five-door hatchback, though the hidden rear door handles maintained a sportier appearance. The dimensions were actually slightly smaller than its predecessor in length and height, but offered more interior space through improved packaging. Engine options included a range of small efficient gasoline engines (0.9 TCe and 1.2 TCe) and diesel variants (1.5 dCi) with power outputs ranging from 75 to 200 horsepower in the Clio RS. Transmission options included manual and dual-clutch automatics, with the RS model exclusively offering the latter. The interior saw a dramatic improvement in quality, design, and technology, featuring a tablet-like touchscreen infotainment system on higher trims with Renault's R-Link system. Safety features expanded to include electronic stability control as standard, multiple airbags, and available driver assistance features. The high-performance Clio RS 200 featured a 1.6-liter turbocharged engine, firmer suspension, and sportier styling elements but was controversial among enthusiasts for switching from a naturally aspirated engine and manual transmission to a turbocharged engine with only a dual-clutch automatic option. A facelift in 2016 introduced refined styling, updated interior technology, and improved engines. The fourth-generation Clio was a commercial success for Renault, consistently ranking among Europe's best-selling vehicles."
